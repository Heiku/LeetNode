/**
 * 933. Number of Recent Calls
 *
 *
 * Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.
 *
 * It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.
 *
 * Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.
 *
 * Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *      Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
 *      Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
